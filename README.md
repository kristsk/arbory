## Coding style

### JS

We use `airbnb` coding style for both JS and SASS (links below).

To install the built-in inspections for PHPStorm, follow these instructions:

#### Note!

When specifying JSCS package in the configuration window, it has to be installed locally (within the project).
Global installation will not work (PHPStorm installs packages globally).

#### Customization

Rules can be modified either in separate files (`.jscsrc` or `.jscs.json` in project's root directory)
or project's `package.json` file (`jscsConfig` section).
